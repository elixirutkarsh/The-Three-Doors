# The-Three-Doors
You are standing in front of three doors. Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You do not know which door hides the car. You are allowed to open one door, but only one, and if you open a door with a goat behind it, you will be forced to take one of the goats and leave without the car.

What is the optimal strategy for choosing a door?

Solution:

The optimal strategy is to open the middle door. This is because, regardless of which door hides the car, the probability of the car being behind the middle door is 1/3. If you open the left or right door, the probability of the car being behind the remaining door is only 1/2.
